This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  Sometimes, `Linking.addEventListener` fails to trigger the callback function when a deep link is opened, even if the app is already running in the background or foreground.  This results in the app not responding to deep links as expected. This is particularly problematic in situations involving Android devices.
